### Flight delays prediction for 15 minutes
Predict whether a flight will be delayed for more than 15 minutes. Flight delays dataset provides interesting opportunities for feature engineering and exploratory data analysis (EDA). General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/flight-delays-fall-2018/data). I'm used catboost model, here is my solution.

### Web-user identification
Web-user identification is a hot research topic on the brink of sequential pattern mining and behavioral psychology.
Here we try to identify a user on the Internet tracking his/her sequence of attended Web pages. The algorithm to be built will take a webpage session (a sequence of webpages attended consequently by the same person) and predict whether it belongs to Alice or somebody else.
The data comes from Blaise Pascal University proxy servers. Paper "A Tool for Classification of Sequential Data" by Giacomo Kahn, Yannick Loiseau and Olivier Raynaud.
